              <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-8">
                The first six weeks of my tenure as High Sheriff of
                Buckinghamshire have been truly inspiring and humbling, as well
                as extremely busy. I have had the distinct privilege of meeting
                remarkable individuals and witnessing the extraordinary
                dedication behind numerous vital causes. These encounters have
                filled me with immense pride for Buckinghamshire and the strong
                sense of community that thrives within it. Countless hours of
                tireless work are invested to foster safer and more inclusive
                environments for all who live and work here. While celebrating
                these achievements, I also recognise the ongoing needs within
                our communities and eagerly anticipate contributing further,
                connecting people, and shining a light on causes that require
                greater visibility.
              </p>
              <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Reflecting on my role as High Sheriff, I am guided by three core
                principles:

                1. Upholding and supporting the principal organs of the
                Constitution
              </h2>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Upholding and supporting the principal organs of the
                Constitution — the Royal Family, the judiciary, the police, the
                prison services and other law enforcement agencies, the
                emergency services, local authorities, and all recognised church
                and faith groups.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Highlights so far include time spent with members of the
                judiciary and the police. I have visited the Coroner's Court and
                Family Court in Milton Keynes sitting with Judge Perusko and a
                District Judge. In the coming month I will be attending
                magistrates' courts in Milton Keynes and High Wycombe and the
                FDAC in High Wycombe. Meetings with Debbie Gibbs, JP, and Mary
                Tucket, JP have been educational in understanding the challenges
                facing the Magistracy. Valuable support from Dennis Murray has
                enabled me to connect with police youth leads. A familiarisation
                day at Thames Valley Police HQ proved fascinating, followed in
                the same week by the Community Fund presentation.

                I also met with Kevin Marshall Clark, Governor of HMP Aylesbury,
                and later this month will be visiting the prison to discuss
                improving access to purposeful work for the prisoners.

                It is now the height of the Mayor making season and when we
                meet, I will have attended three events all very different
                including the traditional honour of being weighed-in at High
                Wycombe.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                The ultimate privilege and honour during my first six weeks has
                been to participate in VE 80 commemorations. On 8th of May in
                High Wycombe I attended the flag raising ceremony, joined a town
                walk where I laid a wreath and took part in a commemorative
                church service. The day concluded with the lighting of the
                beacon at Tom Burt's Hill. On Saturday 10th of May I was
                honoured to attend the Military Cadet Parade at RAF Halton and
                on the 19th of May a Sea and Royal Marine Cadets, Royal Naval
                Parade at Henry Flod School, Aylesbury.

                Since taking office, I have done two more Heart of Bucks

                Chesham, and Princess Risborough. As vice president of Heart of
                Bucks this year it is a pleasure to celebrate their 25th
                anniversary visiting charities who have received grants and
                spotlighting the work they do.

              <p class="mb-4">
                Upholding and enhancing the ancient office of High Sheriff,
                making a meaningful contribution to the county during my year of
                office.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                My first theme for this year is providing young people with the
                best possible start in life and letting them be heard. To
                support this, I have met with representatives from Milton Keynes
                College, Bucks College Group, Waddesdon School, and Wycombe
                Grammar School. I have also visited Cafe Democracy, Aylesbury
                Youth Council, and various charities that amplify young voices,
                The Cygnet awards led by Chesham Youth Council being a
                particular highlight.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Building on my declaration ceremony held at the Scout's
                wonderful Jubilee Hall in Amersham, I attended the county's
                annual Scouting dinner and attended a county-wide awards
                ceremony for the cubs and scouts with the Lord Lieutenant last
                Saturday.

                My second theme is promoting volunteering, wherever I go
                celebrating those volunteers who are the fabric of our county. I
                am working with Chris Hall on a photography and storytelling
                initiative called Heart of Buckinghamshire. Over the next six
                months, Chris is travelling the county capturing images and
                stories of volunteering in all its forms. He has already
                documented several inspiring stories from a wonderfully diverse
                group of volunteers. We plan to exhibit these photographs and
                stories in public places over the autumn.
