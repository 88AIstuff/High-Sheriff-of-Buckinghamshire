The Office of High Sheriff, as we know, dates back to Saxon times, when the 'Shire Reeve' was responsible to the King for the maintenance of law and order within the shire, or county, and for the collection and return of taxes due to the Crown. Whilst the duties of the role have evolved over time, supporting the Crown and the judiciary remain central elements of the role today. This overarching responsibility offers High Sheriffs a unique opportunity to provide a platform to engage those in the justice system with key issues for our communities and county. I wanted to shine a light on the importance of social inclusion, building partnerships and collaboration.
It was a privilege to host a symposium in February 2025 to open a conversation on school exclusion and its relationship to criminality. We know, and research shows, that young people excluded from school are
more likely to end up in the criminal justice system.

<p>It was a privilege to host a symposium in February 2025 to open a conversation on school exclusion and its relationship to criminality. We know, and research shows, that young people excluded from school are
more likely to end up in the criminal justice system. Early in my year, and with the support of Milton Keynes Community Foundation, I facilitated a number of workshops with a wide range of stakeholders to hear the challenges around the issue of school inclusion/exclusion for our city and county. From this listening, I was able to bring together a planning
group to work with me to host a School Inclusion and Crime Prevention Symposium. The Planning Group comprised both unitary councils in my county – Buckinghamshire Council and Milton Keynes City Council,
along with Thames Valley Police, MK College, MK Community Foundation, Sieve MK Gateway, the Safety Centre, and Bletchley Park. Chaired by Her Honour Judge Esther Maclachlan, of the Milton Keynes Family and Civil Court Centre, the symposium provided an opportunity to raise awareness, share the experience of young people, celebrate good practice and recognise the importance of partnership and collaboration for future
dialogue and a call for action so that no child is left behind.
The Directors of Children Services at Milton Keynes City Council and Buckinghamshire Council provided a high-level overview of the rising national issues and challenges in relation to school inclusion. They talked
of the increasing pressures and expectations on local authorities and schools – including funding and workforce pressures, reflecting on the risk factors that can lead to exclusions and exploitation. Jade Barnett, Co-Founder of Power2Prevail, using video testimonies of personal stories from young people across our county, shared the lived experience of the difference culturally appropriate, collaborative and sensitive interventions can make in creating positive outcomes for young people on the edge of exclusion.
The symposium finished with a focus on learning and sharing of good practice. This included: the Milton Keynes Inclusion Partnership which brings schools to work together to keep young people within the school system; the School Navigator – an innovative project by Thames Valley Police; Youth Justice Service; the Virtual School and Restore Hope – based in Chesham. A key message going forward is how the community and voluntary sector can support schools, colleges and the justice system by providing valuable respite and activities to divert young people from criminality.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>To quote our two Directors of Children Services – Mac Heath and John Macilwraith:
‘The question of responsibility for these children is a collective one, requiring a coordinated effort from all stakeholders.’
This symposium was more than a networking opportunity – it was a call to action. It was about saying ‘I don’t have all the solutions, no one size fits all, but I make the intention to learn, share and work to bring positive change to create a better future for our young people’. Going forward, our collaboration will continue as part of the new Youth Inclusion and Crime Prevention Collaborative.
The Justice Dinner I held in February 2025 provided a further platform to continue the dialogue about investing in young people. Young people from MK YMCA shared their powerful lived experience. This alongside HH Judge Patrick Perusko and HH Judge Jonathan Cooper who spoke profoundly about how both the criminal and family courts have evolved over the years to better empower young people and involve them in the justice process so giving them agency.
It was important to me to not only give voice to young people by inviting them to speak at the Justice Dinner, but also include other young people seldom heard or seen in the guest list of 50. They were sitting in the Bletchley Park Mansion Ballroom alongside influencers and policy makers as equals. The meal was cooked and served by MK College Catering and Hospitality students who worked with me to fulfil my culturally and faith specific menu. I had appointed High Sheriff College Champions for my year in keeping with my passion to include, inspire and empower young people. Eight students from the Buckinghamshire College Group and MK College worked with me throughout my Shrieval Year accompanying me to numerous visits and engagements. They were also able to benefit from the
experience of meeting and talking with the judiciary as well as working with Thames Valley Police on their projects to tackle crime focusing on Violence against Women and Girls and Domestic Abuse. I was proud to nominate my Bucks College Group for a National Crimebeat Award especially, as we have
not had an entry from Buckinghamshire for some time now.</p>

<p>It is a credit to the office of High Sheriff how it opens doors and gives High Sheriffs a unique platform to focus on key issues, shining a light to  readdress imbalances within their counties. I am indebted to the Office of the High Sheriff to be able to do this in my year. It has been an honour and privilege.</p>
